# Git and GitHub

## Introduction

Git is a version control system that is used to track changes in the source code during the software development process. It is designed to coordinate the work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and is used for collaboration. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which acquired the company in 2018 for $7.5 billion. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
