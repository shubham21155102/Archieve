Once the data is out, you often need to sort it or group it to make it more understandable or to perform additional operations. In SQL, the ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses are essential for sorting and grouping your data. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these features, helping you advance from beginner-level SQL to more intermediate capabilities.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Sorting with ORDER BY</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the rows that are retrieved by a SQL query. You can sort the data in ascending (default) or descending order based on one or more columns.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Syntax</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>SELECT columns FROM table ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Examples</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Sort Employees by their first names:</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY FirstName ASC;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Sort Employees by their department and then by their age:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>SELECT Department, FirstName, Age FROM Employees ORDER BY Department ASC, Age DESC;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Grouping with GROUP BY</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like "total salary by department".</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Syntax</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2) FROM table GROUP BY column1;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Examples</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Count employees in each department:</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Calculate the average age of employees in each department:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>SELECT Department, AVG(Age) FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Combining ORDER BY and GROUP BY</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>You can use both ORDER BY and GROUP BY in a single query to group your data first and then sort those groups.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Example</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees GROUP BY Department ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Filtering Groups with HAVING</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The HAVING clause allows you to filter the groups based on aggregate calculations.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Example</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees GROUP BY Department HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Best Practices</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Use GROUP BY before ORDER BY if you're using both in a query.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Be mindful of the performance implications of sorting and grouping, especially on large datasets.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Use aliases for more readable code when using aggregate functions.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Summary</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Sorting and grouping are essential operations for data summarization, analytics, and presentation. SQL provides robust capabilities for both through the ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses. By mastering these clauses, you can perform a wide range of data manipulation tasks efficiently. As you continue your journey into SQL, understanding the nuances of sorting and grouping will undoubtedly make your data manipulation tasks more streamlined and insightful.</span></p></div><div class="track_mark_as_read_btn__qp09Q g-mt-5"><button class="ui green disabled button" disabled="" tabindex="-1">Marked as Read</button></div></div>
