These allow you to fetch, update, delete, and manage data effectively. However, writing efficient queries requires a good understanding of various SQL functionalities like using DISTINCT, aliasing, and how to view or debug your queries. This comprehensive guide will provide an overview of these aspects, complete with examples to make you more proficient in query writing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Theory: Basics of SQL Queries</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases. The most fundamental type of SQL command is the query, which retrieves data based on specific criteria. These queries can range from very simple commands fetching data from a single table to complex queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregations.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><u><b><strong class="GFGEditorTheme__textUnderline">SELECT Statement</strong></b></u></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The basic syntax of an SQL query starts with the SELECT statement.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><i><b><strong class="GFGEditorTheme__textItalic">SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;</strong></b></i></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Making Queries DISTINCT</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><u><span class="GFGEditorTheme__textUnderline">Why Use DISTINCT?</span></u></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The DISTINCT keyword is used to return unique records in the output. It eliminates all duplicate rows and returns only distinct entries.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Example:</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Consider a Students table where the same CourseID may appear multiple times, once for each student enrolled in that course.</span></p><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><i><em class="GFGEditorTheme__textItalic">SELECT DISTINCT CourseID FROM Students;</em></i></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>This query would return each CourseID only once, no matter how many students are enrolled in each course.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><u><b><strong class="GFGEditorTheme__textUnderline">Aliasing in SQL</strong></b></u></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>What is Aliasing?</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Aliasing is the process of renaming a table or a column temporarily during the query execution. This can be particularly useful for making column names more readable and for disambiguating in the case of joins and subqueries.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Column Aliasing Example:</strong></b></p><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><i><em class="GFGEditorTheme__textItalic">SELECT FirstName AS "First Name", LastName AS "Last Name" FROM Employees;</em></i></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Table Aliasing Example:</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In queries involving joins, table aliasing can make the query more readable.</span></p><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><i><em class="GFGEditorTheme__textItalic">SELECT a.FirstName, b.DepartmentName</em></i></p><p dir="ltr"><i><em class="GFGEditorTheme__textItalic">FROM Employees AS a</em></i></p><p dir="ltr"><i><em class="GFGEditorTheme__textItalic">JOIN Departments AS b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID;</em></i></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><u><b><strong class="GFGEditorTheme__textUnderline">Viewing Your Queries</strong></b></u></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Running and Debugging</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In GUI-based tools: SQL queries can be viewed and run in various GUI-based tools like SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL Workbench, etc. These tools often provide features for debugging and optimizing queries.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In Command Line: If you are using the command line, queries are usually executed in the SQL shell.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In Programming Languages: In languages like Python, Java, or C#, SQL queries are often executed using libraries that connect to databases. Debugging involves viewing console logs or using debugging tools specific to the language.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Query Logs</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Most database management systems offer query logs, which keep a history of all executed queries. You can refer to these logs for debugging or performance tuning.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Example</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In MySQL, you can view the query log by accessing the log file or by running the SHOW QUERIES command depending on your permissions and settings.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><b><strong>Summary</strong></b></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Writing SQL queries is a fundamental skill for data manipulation in relational databases. Learning how to make your queries distinct helps in fetching unique records, while aliasing aids in improving query readability and disambiguating complex queries. Various tools and logs can assist you in viewing and debugging your queries, making the entire data retrieval process efficient and effective.</span><br></p></div><div class="track_mark_as_read_btn__qp09Q g-mt-5"><button class="ui green disabled button" disabled="" tabindex="-1">Marked as Read</button></div></div>
